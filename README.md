## Project
> **No64** is **a client-side mod** for Minecraft that **allows a 64-bit OS to isguise itself as a 32-bit one**.

***The mod changes the method that checks the device for a 64-bit OS to one that will always return false. This allows you to receive banners and notifications that your device is 32-bit or that a 32-bit device may not be supported by Minecraft in the future.***

> [!WARNING]
> **No64 may cause errors or problems**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mod **works only on the client side**.
